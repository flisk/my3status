# my3status

This is a relatively modest C program that serves as my [i3](https://i3wm.org/)
status line generator, written for fun and C practice. It supports:

* My jury-rigged medication tracking system
* PulseAudio volume level/mute state
* System load and uptime
* Used disk space
* Date and time

## Installation & Usage

*This program is not intended for general use*. For this reason, no further
documentation is provided. If you want to try compiling, using or hacking on
this, knock yourself out.
